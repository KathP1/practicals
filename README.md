### What I have learnt about "clean code"

Clean code:

- improves readability of programs through consistent use of patterns and naming rules
- makes it easier to pick up exceptions
- has a lower maintenance burden - eg specific comments make code less robust for reuse, it would be better to use general terms such as 'save to a file' rather than naming a specific file.
